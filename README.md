# Support Vector Machines - Week 1

Implementing a Support Vector Machine based linear image classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization. The dataset has 50000 images for 10 classes of images (car, cat, deer, frog, ...)

### Usage

* Download the dataset by running `./getdataset.sh` shell script in _SVM-Week1/f16RBE595/data_ 
* Run the `SVM.py` python script to obtain results.

PS - The shell script might not run unless the privileges are correct and it is declared as an executable(Linux)

### Results

As expected, due to poor resolution of the images(32 X 32 X 3) and this being a very naive implementation of the algorithm, the results obtained were not very good.

* Training Accuracy: ~0.38
* Testing Accuraccy: ~0.41

The final template generated by the weight matrix for all the classes shown below indicates a few classes like car, horse, truck and frog resemble a general representation satisfactorily while other class templates are  not very clear.
